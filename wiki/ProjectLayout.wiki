= Contained projects and their dependencies =

Short outline of the contained source projects and how they relate to each other

== SML, SMP, START and LIME ==

  * commons-peppol = PEPPOL specific implementation of BusDox with the predefined semantics
  * commons-jpa = Base library for JPA2 handling with [http://www.eclipse.org/eclipselink/ EclipseLink]
  * sml-server-library = Library containing most of the SML code for reuse in the main SML and the standalone SML
  * transport-api = Base library for LIME and START also containing the SPI interface for START receivers

===Production artefacts:===
  * sml-webapp = SML server (web application)
  * sml-client-library = SML client (library)
  * smp-webapp = SMP server (web application)
  * smp-client-library = SMP client (library)
  * transport-start-server = START server (web application)
  * transport-start-client = START client (library)
  * transport-lime-server = LIME server (web application)
  * transport-lime-library = LIME client (library)

===Utility artefacts:===
  * sml-webapp-standalone = a standalone SML server for testing without DNS
  * sml-client-apps = console and Swing GUI to do SML client actions
  * smp-client-console = console application to access the SMP
  * transport-start-receiver = an example handler for incoming documents on the START server - to be replaced in production environments
  * transport-lime-client = example application using the LIME library to send a document via LIME

== Validation and visualization ==

===Library artefacts:===
  * commons-cenbii = Contains the CEN BII profile, transaction and collaboration definitions
