#summary The change log of the software components

= v2.3.0 - in progress =

==Base libraries==
  * Removed all deprecated methods using "Document" instead of "DocumentType" in their names
==LIME==
  * Improved exception handling when handling an incoming document
  * Move the contents of the "transport-lime-library" project into the "transport-lime-client" project and removed the "transport-lime-library" project so that the structure is consistent to the one of START
==Validation==
  * Added a new project "validation-webapp" that provides a minimum web application for validating your PEPPOL documents in the web

= v2.2.1 (2012-03-21, bugfix release) =

This is a bugfix release. No main feature extensions are contained.

Performed changes so far:
==All components==
  * Fixed errors indicated by FindBugs
  * Improved source comments and added some informational annotations
==Base libraries==
  * Added easier readable constants in EPredefinedDocumentTypeIdentifier and EPredefinedProcessIdentifier
  * Updated phloc-commons to 3.4.8
  * Renamed all "DocumentIdentifier" APIs to "DocumentTypeIdentifier" as this is the correct terminus. The old methods got deprecated and will be removed in v2.3.0
  * Updated predefined enumerations to support the codelist v1.1.0 as stated in the PEPPOL policy for use of identifiers v2.2 from 2012-03-20
==SML==
  * Improved the SML Client Swing GUI to be more easily usable
  * Updated h2 to 1.3.165 for the standalone version
==SMP==
  * Updated Jersey (REST libs) from 1.11 to 1.12
  * Improved logging in SMP startup to find keystore configuration errors more easily
  * SMP: Deprecated CompleteServiceGroupInterface.deleteServiceGroup because it has the exact same semantics as ServiceGroupInterface.deleteServiceGroup
==START==
  * Fixed error in transport-start-filereceiver SPI configuration file
==LIME==
  * LIME projects now also use the Metro libraries instead of JAX-WS directly to improve interoperability with deployed START Access Points. Thanks to Giannis for identifying the issue - was a tricky one.
==Validation==
  * Improved schematron2xslt Maven plugin thanks to Maarten van Schouwen
==Visualization==
  * Added visualization of Credit Notes

= v2.2.0 (2012-02-09, initial release, all components) =

The main target of this release is to have an easy transition from the previous repository on JoinUp.
All package names are now starting with "at.peppol" instead of "eu.peppol" but the classes itself haven't been renamed, so a simple "Organize imports" (in Eclipse) should do the trick.
All components were released except the visualization component, as it requires some additional coding.

Functional improvements:
  * LIME client and server were updated, so that they are using the correct START client compared to Joinup
  * The WSDL file handling of LIME has been unified, so that they need to be maintained only once - equal to the START implementation
  * The name of the LIME WebService has been changed to "limeService" as it is more speaking than the old "wstransferService"
  * The LIME client does not expect the LIME server to have a PEPPOL based https certificate (thanks to Stefano for clarification)
  * A potential memory leak in the SMP (PostRegistrationFilter) has been resolved
  * Some missing transaction rollbacks in the SMP server have been resolved
  * The endpoint address of the START AP is now read from the configServer.properties configuration file to be more flexible
