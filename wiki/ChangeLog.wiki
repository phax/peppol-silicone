#summary The change log of the software components

= v2.2.0 (2012-02-09, initial release, all components) =

The main target of this release is to have an easy transition from the previous repository on JoinUp.
All package names are now starting with "at.peppol" instead of "eu.peppol" but the classes itself haven't been renamed, so a simple "Organize imports" (in Eclipse) should do the trick.

Functional improvements:
  * LIME client and server were updated, so that they are using the correct START client compared to Joinup
  * The WSDL file handling of LIME has been unified, so that they need to be maintained only once - equal to the START implementation
  * The name of the LIME WebService has been changed to "limeService" as it is more speaking than the old "wstransferService"
  * The LIME client does not expect the LIME server to have a PEPPOL based https certificate (thanks to Stefano for clarification)
  * A potential memory leak in the SMP (PostRegistrationFilter) has been resolved
  * Some missing transaction rollbacks in the SMP server have been resolved
